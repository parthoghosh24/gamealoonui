					  		What started off temporarily as a personal video game blog in mid- 2012, turned up into a whole new thing in 2013. Gamealoon is a first of its kind unique video gamer sourced information platform. What this mean that video gamers can come on this platform and share their opinions and thoughts with the world in the form of reviews, news, videos and gloonicles. And in return, the world gets to know the pulse of the video gamers that is what gamers think of a particular favorite video game, what they think of video gaming in general, what hot is going on in video game industry and so on. Due to this collaboration system, in case of a review, a particular video game's score will reflect the actual mindset of gamers. So if your favorite video game is scored 9.7/10 (which will vary as more users will review it), that means video gamers actually think that this game deserved 9.7 out of 10 thanks to the carefully crafted game scoring algorithm which just simply doesn't consider the average of scores given. Along with this, user gets to interact with other users via the gamealoon social network and can work his/her way up to leaderboards while contributing to the system. So what are you waiting for, register, login and go crazy over gaming. Welcome to Gamealoon.

			  	<span class="marginLeft5">...Or should I say who is the brain behind, then it has to be me, Partho Ghosh. The idea was simple, that is, to create a platform where gamers can come and generate video gamer centric information which will result in a pool of gaming information which highlights the pulse of gamers around the world. World will get to know the verdict and pulse of gamers in general in place of some random critic. Keeping these things in mind, I started coding <a href="/" class="colorOrange">Gamealoon.com</a> from the month of May, 2013 dayin-dayout and released this first BETA almost after a period of 6 months. Things were tough as firstly I was alone and secondly, I lost my job due to a freak accident I met on January 2013 but frankly speaking, the love and passion for video gaming and computer science kept me going for this. Now, accompanied by two more passionate game lovers, our goal is to make this system reach to the intended users, that is gamers all around the world and convert it into a phenomenon in the world of gaming. Use this and <a href="#feedback" class="colorOrange">let us know</a> what do you think, liked or did not like about this system. Welcome to Gamealoon and Happy Gaming.
